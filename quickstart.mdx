## Getting Started

To begin using the Niobi Payments API, please follow these steps:

Obtain API Key: You can set up an account with Niobi to obtain API key required for authentication.

Authenticate API Requests: Include your API key in the request headers for every API call to authenticate your requests. The API key can be obtained by signing up for a developer account with Niobi.

## Setting up a Niobi Account

To access the Niobi Payments API, you need to create an account on our platform and then add a developer account in the Workspace section. Follow the steps below to get started:

<Steps>
 <Step title="Selecting environment">
  1. Open your web browser and visit https://dev.niobi.co/register if you are just starting out integrating Niobi and want to connect with our sandbox environment.
  2. When you have successfully integrated with our sandbox, and completed all compliance requirements (see below) you can use the link
   https://app.niobi.co/register for production environment.
 </Step>
 <Step title="Registration">
   Click on the "Sign Up" button to create a new account. Fill in the required information, such as your name, email address, and password. Accept the terms and conditions, and then click on "Sign Up" to proceed. We ask that only managers/owners of the business set up their business account first and then invite other team members to the platform later.
 </Step>
 <Step title="Inviting a user">
  1. Once you have created your account, you need to invite the developer who will be working on the integration. 
  To do this, navigate to the “Workspace” section on the left sidebar.

  2. Within the Workspace tab, you will see an option to manage your “Team”.
   Navigate to it and click the “Invite Users” button.

  3. Once you click it, you will see the option of adding emails and roles of the team members you want to invite.

  4. Please add the email of the team member that needs to be invited and set their role as “Developer”.

  5. The invited team member will now receive an invitation to sign up.
 </Step>
 <Step title="Registering developer account">
  1. The invited team member will now receive an invitation to sign up.
  2.  The developer should sign up using the link provided in their email. 
 </Step>
 <Step title="Generating API Keys">
   In the developer account Workspace, you will find an option to generate API keys. Click on the "API Keys" button. The API key generation process will provide you with a unique API key. This key serves as your authentication mechanism when making API requests. Make sure to securely store your API key and avoid sharing it publicly.
 </Step>
 <Step title="Creating a new integration">
 Begin by creating your first integration by clicking the “Create Integration” button. We recommend creating one integration for each of the projects you are using the APIs with.
 </Step>
 <Step title="Creating credentials">
  Within the Integration settings, the developer can generate the required credentials for the integration. These credentials typically consist of a Client ID and Secret Key. Make sure to save these credentials securely.
 </Step>
 <Step title="Using the credentials">
 You are now ready to integrate the Niobi Payments API into your application. Include the API key in the request headers as shown in the authentication section of this documentation.
