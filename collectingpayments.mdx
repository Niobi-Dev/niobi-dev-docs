#### Payment Collection through USSD Push

USSD push is a convenient way to collect payments directly from a customer's mobile phone. This method is widely used due to its simplicity and accessibility, even on basic mobile devices.

**How It Works:**

- ***Initiate Request:*** Your system initiates a USSD push request to the customer’s mobile number.
- ***Customer Authorization:*** The customer receives a prompt on their phone to authorize the payment.
- ***Completion:*** Once the customer authorizes, the transaction is processed, and funds are transferred to your Niobi wallet.

**Benefits:**

- ***Accessibility:*** Works on all mobile phones.
-  ***Security:*** Payments are secured with customer authorization.
- ***Speed:*** Transactions are completed swiftly.


#### Payment Collection via Payment Links
Payment links are a flexible way to collect payments without the need for a physical point of sale or a complex integration.

**How It Works:**
- ***Create a Payment Link:*** Generate a unique payment link through your Niobi Payments dashboard.
- ***Share the Link:*** Send this link to your customers via email, SMS, or any other communication platform.
- ***Customer Payment:*** The customer clicks on the link, which takes them to a secure payment page where they can choose their preferred method of payment.
- ***Receive Confirmation:*** Once the payment is completed, you receive a confirmation, and the funds are credited to your 
Niobi wallet.

***Supported Payment Methods on Payment Links:***
- Credit/Debit Cards *(coming soon)*
- Mobile Money

**Benefits:**

- ***Convenience:*** Easily shareable via any digital platform.
- ***Flexibility:*** Accepts various payment methods.
- ***Real-Time Tracking:*** Monitor payments in real-time.
